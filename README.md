# Neural Style Transfer

This is the replicated ANN contributing as final project to the course "Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with TensorFlow"!
Additionally, you can find the original paper by Gatys et al. (2015) under "Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style.pdf" as well as an example of the style transfer for a labrador dog as content image and a painting by Picasso as style image.
<br />
As a basis for the code, we partially followed along the TensorFlow tutorial on the official website (see tensorflow.org).
