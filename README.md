# Final-Project-IANNWTF

Here we upload our final project for the course "Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with TensorFlow"!  
Additionally, you can find the original paper by Gatys et al. under "Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style.pdf" as well as an example of the style transfer for a labrador dog as content image and a painting by Picasso as style image.
